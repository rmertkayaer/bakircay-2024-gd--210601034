# Bakırçay Fall-2024 Game Development

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the materials and instructions for a two-part game development assignment in Unity. Students will progressively build a simplified 3D matching game, divided into two phases: a midterm and a final exam.

### Assets
All necessary models, animations, and UI assets required for this project are provided in this repository.

## Important Notes
- **Deadline:** Make sure to submit your repository link before the due date.
- **Unity Version:** Ensure your project is compatible with Unity 2022.3.50 or above.
- **Screen Capture Tips:** Ensure the gameplay is clearly visible and captures the main gameplay elements.
- **README:** Ensure the README is detailed and includes a preview of the gameplay.

## Submission Instructions
- **GitHub Repository:** Create a GitHub repository for your project. To submit your project, send the link with your student info to [seref@blendedgames.com](mailto:seref@blendedgames.com).
  
- **Repository Name (optional but preferred):** Follow the naming convention: 
```
bakircay-2024-gd-<StudentNumber>.
```

- **Repository Structure:** Create a repository with a `README.md` and `.gitignore` file for Unity. Include the Unity project files organized in standard folders (Assets, Scenes, Scripts, etc.).

- **Gameplay Screen Capture:** Capture a short screen recording of your game in action, showing the required functionality. Place the recording in the `README.md` file under the "Gameplay Preview" section (see example below). The capture should clearly show the game area, placement area, and UI elements.

- **README.md:** Include the following sections in your README:
  - **Project Overview:** A brief summary of the project’s goals and requirements.
  - **Gameplay Preview:** Include a screenshot or link to a screen recording of the game.

## Midterm Project (Due Date: 22 Nov 2024, Friday 23:59)
In the midterm phase, students will:

1. **Basic Game Setup:**
 - **Game Area:** Set up a central area where 3D objects are scattered randomly.
 - **Placement Area:** Create a circular placement area at the bottom of the screen where players can place objects.

2. **Object Interaction:**
 - **Object Movement:** Implement functionality for players to pick up and drag objects using touch or mouse input.
 - **Object Placement:** Ensure players can place only one object in the designated placement area at a time.

  **Bonus (Optional):**	
  - Additional creative gameplay features, visual polish, or UI enhancements beyond midterm requirements. The bonus points are optional and awarded for extra effort, such as adding subtle effects, animations, or aesthetic improvements.

## Final Project (requirements are subject to change)
In the final phase, students will:

1. **Game Enhancements:**
   - **Paired Objects:** Add paired objects to the game area.
   - **Matching Mechanics:** Enable matching mechanics within the placement area.
   - **Score Display:** Display the score in the UI to reflect successful matches.

2. **Requirements:**
   - **Pairing and Matching Logic:** Correct implementation of pairing and matching logic.
   - **Score UI:** Functional UI displaying the player's score.

**Bonus (Optional):**
